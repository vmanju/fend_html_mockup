You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
HTML and DOM structure

  * What has been easy?
Markups are easy, javascript programming paradigms are the ones I get tricked with.

  * What has been difficult?
Javascript! Coming from Java programming background, JS seems hard.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I don’t give up! I remind myself that I am stupid only because I don’t know how to do something yet. And that keeps me going. Also, I haven’t leveraged student forums so far - which can be valuable when I get stuck.
